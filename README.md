Our project is based on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Goal 13: Climate Action. This is a web based project made using HTML, ReactJS framework and CSS and hosted on github pages. As
the project is hosted, and live, no tools or dependencies are required to run in other devices. One has to click the link to the webpage https://rohammaiti.github.io/Earth_guardians/   to use the project.
To access the other links just simply click on the links and to move around the webpage, we have provided navigation links at top and bottom of the webpage as well. We have provided a google form through which
we can collect data on the pollution level of the user's area. We also have provided a link validation system so that the user is not redirected to another page until and unless the permission is given by the
user him/herself. The website has been made device friendly as much as possible, still if any errors or bugs occur, feel free to mail us. We still recommend to use this website on desktop and laptops as mobile
version lacks some features. To return back to the homepage quickly, we have provided buttons at the end of each webpage.
